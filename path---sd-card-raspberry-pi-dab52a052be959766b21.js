Not me apparently.</strong>\nThe only card I ended up with had a broken case and therefore didn’t fit into the Raspberry. The SD even had an old image of Raspbian flashed on it already – apparently I used it in the past for some projects.</p>\n<p>In my despair I decided to directly solder the SD card to the tray on the RPi.\nThe idea wasn’t even half bad since I didn’t care about the old Pi and just wanted it to work again <em>somehow</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>And it did work!</strong> I was very careful with the soldering and I even had to bridge one of the pins on the tray in order for it to work. The bootup went fine and I was in high spirits since I kind off felt like I wrecked the Pi in the process of soldering.\nMy excitement lasted exactly 8 more second until Raspbian asked me for the <strong>password</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is where it gets really sad. Not even had I changed the default password on the old Raspbian install, I apparently even set a <strong>good</strong> one. I spent the next few hours trying different passwords, got an expert in ssh-brute forcing and finally gave up.\nI had no way to flash a different image on the Pi since it was soldered to the board like the image shows.</p>\n<p>What did I learn?
