They look terrible, are a pain to use, littered with ads and just in general not a nice experience.</p>\n<p>As a big fan of selfhosting I wanted something that was under my control. <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a perfect solution for an isolated problem like a Youtube Downloader, but after some research I realized that there was no such thing for Docker yet (Okey, there was no <strong>good</strong> one). I was really excited because this seemed like a nice opportunity to finally stress my homeserver a bit. Up to this point it was basically converting electricity to heat at terrible efficiency. The coding was done using <strong>react</strong> for the frontend and a <strong>hapi</strong>-webserver in the backend <em>(You gotta love Node.js)</em>.</p>\n<p>Since everything on my homeserver is running in an isolated Docker-Container, the <code>ytdl-webserver</code> <em>(thats what I will call this from now on)</em> needed a <code>Dockerfile</code>. Those are extremely easy to set up and it still blows my mind how much it abstracts from the complicated matter of an OS. I will show you mine:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-docker"><code><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true"># Dockerfile for ytdl-webserver</span>\n\n<span class="token keyword">FROM</span> ubuntu<span class="token punctuation">:</span>16.04\n\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> apt<span class="token punctuation">-</span>get update\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> apt<span class="token punctuation">-</span>get install <span class="token punctuation">-</span>y curl\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> curl <span class="token punctuation">-</span>sL https<span class="token punctuation">:</span>//deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x <span class="token punctuation">|</span> bash <span class="token punctuation">-</span>\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> apt<span class="token punctuation">-</span>get install <span class="token punctuation">-</span>y nodejs\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> apt<span class="token punctuation">-</span>get install <span class="token punctuation">-</span>y ffmpeg\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> apt<span class="token punctuation">-</span>get install <span class="token punctuation">-</span>y youtube<span class="token punctuation">-</span>dl\n\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> mkdir <span class="token punctuation">-</span>p /home/app\n<span class="token keyword">WORKDIR</span> /home/app\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> mkdir <span class="token punctuation">-</span>p public/temp\n\n<span class="token keyword">COPY</span> . /home/app\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> npm install\n<span class="token keyword">RUN</span> npm run build\n\n<span class="token keyword">EXPOSE</span> 3000\n<span class="token keyword">CMD</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span> <span class="token string">"npm"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"start"</span> <span class="token punctuation">]</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Isn’t that amazing? You build an image from this file and have an application that can run <strong>everywhere</strong> without having to know <strong>anything</strong> about the underlying OS? <strong>What a time to be alive!</strong></p>\n<h2>2 What does it do</h2>\n<p class="notice notice--info">tldr; Watch the GIF down below</p>\n<p>At the moment the application takes a link from a YouTube video as an input. Then the video gets downloaded with the popular command line tool <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>. Once it is finished it gets converted to an MP3. Note that I plan on adding other options here like downloading the video without converting, converting it to different formats, etc.</p>\n<p>Functionality like that is easy to implement with the current structure, so if you enjoy coding as much as I do, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Algram/ytdl-webserver">project page</a> and <strong>contribute</strong>.</p>\n<p>I also added some kind of web storage caching for the already downloaded videos and tried to keep everything as consistent as possible. The project is far from finished though, so give it some love.</p>\n<p><img src="/c17269de96d99589aefc6e571030f40d.gif" alt="Youtube Downloader" title="Youtube Downloader Demonstration GIF"></p>\n<h2>3 Using it</h2>\n<p>The appliation is super easy to get going. Everything runs with Node.js, so installing is a matter of one line. Since the GitHub-Repo also includes the <code>Dockerfile</code> you can even build your own image and host it wherever you want!</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true"># Run the application locally</span>\n<span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">npm</span> start\n\n<span class="token comment" spellcheck="true"># Build a docker-image and run it anywhere</span>\ndocker build -t <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>your username<span class="token operator">></span>/ytdl-webserver <span class="token keyword">.</span>\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 -d <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>your username<span class="token operator">></span>/ytdl-webserver\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I hope this article deemed useful to someone who can now selfhost their own Youtube Downloader.
